## Introduction

This is a [full stack Angular battleship game ](https://battleship-0q3l.onrender.com/)  [battleship](https://battleship-0q3l.onrender.com/). In order to enhance my knowledge on typescript, I decided to use Angular instead of a simple vanilla js program. It is hosted on Render.com and was developed using the Angular framework. 

To see the website in action, [click here](https://battleship-0q3l.onrender.com/). Please note it takes the website some time to load up as it is hosted on the free plan.

## Technologies

The application runs on:
- Angular 16.1.5
- Express 4.18.2

As well as other dependencies and dev dependencies as detailed in the package.json. The site is hosted on the free plan of Render.com

## Setup

To run this project:
- Clone the repository
- Install dependencies and dev dependencies found in package.json

```
$ npm run build
$ npm start
```

## Project Status

The project is complete.

## Challenges Faced

The project was relatively simple to complete, with the only tough parts being how to make the computer smarter in its attacks.

## Future Implementation

- Introduce probability for computer attacks to make it smarter

## Acknowledgements

I referred to various Angular documentations to get the project up and running. This project was done as an assignment from The Odin Project.
